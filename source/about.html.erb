    <p>Do you dream of someday writing software that helps people and improves the world?</p>
    <p>Led by an all-volunteer team of seasoned, enthusiastic Ruby and Rails developers, the workshop introduces women of all backgrounds to the concepts, tools, and techniques of Ruby and Rails development. Our audience is those with no or little programming experience.</p>
    <p>We welcome you to the Boston Ruby community. Whatever your goal is in learning to program, we hope to connect you with the tools to take the next step.</p>

    <p>The Boston software scene needs more women. So this workshop is for women and their guests. You should identify as a woman, or be the male guest of a woman who is attending.</p>
    <p>We support mothers who want to code. We will provide childcare to those who need it. Please let us know if you want to use these services on the application form.</p>
